    \begin{problem}{3}
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
            \item Suppose $A$ is an $n$-by-$n$ orthogonal matrix. Show that all its singular values are equal to 1.
            \item Recall that an orthogonal projector is a symmetric matrix $P$ for which $P^2=P$. What are the eigenvalues of an orthogonal projector?
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{problem}

    \begin{solution}{a}
        Let us suppose that $A$ is an $n \times n$ orthogonal matrix. This means that $A^T A = I$. Because the singular values of $A$ are simply the square roots of the eigenvalues of $A^T A$ then the singular values of $A$ are equal to the eigenvalues of $I$. Since all eigenvalues of $I$ are $1$ and since $\sqrt{1} = 1$ then it holds that all $n \times n$ orthogonal matrices have all singular values equal to $1$.
    \end{solution}

    \newpage
    
    \begin{solution}{b}
        The eigenvalues of $P$ are represented by $\lambda$ in the equation $P \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}$. Since $P = P^2$ then it holds that $\lambda^2 \vec{v} = P^2 \vec{v} = P \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}$. We can manipulate it to obtain the following.
        \begin{align*}
            P^2 \vec{v} &= P \vec{v} \\
            \lambda^2 \vec{v} &= \lambda \vec{v} \\
            \lambda^2 &= \lambda \\
            \lambda^2 - \lambda &= 0 \\
            \lambda (1 - \lambda) &= 0 \\
            \lambda &= 0, 1
        \end{align*}
        Thus we conclude that orthogonal projectors can only have values that are either $0$ or $1$. However, since orthogonal projectors are also symmetric $n \times n$ matrices, then it holds that the only eigenvalue that an orthogonal projector can have is $\lambda = 1$.
    \end{solution}
